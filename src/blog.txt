Think that I have to re-structure our code because it looks pretty messay right now. Also a new feature I thought was to an "attack" feature, that will destroy the wall in front of the player. Which meant that I have to indicate which way the player is currently facing ... more work to do.

Starting to re-construct the code.
First create classes:
Constants.java			- an interface that contain all the constant variables
Game.java				- contains the static main that is used to run the entire game
GameControl.java		- an controller class that listener 
GameGraphics.java		-
